<h1>Static Comp Challenge 1</h1>

<h3>Brief overview of the project</h3>
<p>Static Comp 1 is a series of three challenges to practice HTML and CSS as well as design layout. The exercise was to reacreate a static comp with growing complexity from previous projects. While we had free reign with the content, images, icons, and color palette our mission was to remain true to the layout of the comp given to us. </p>

<h3>Personal insight</h3>
This project stretched my abilities in new ways (hover, cards, etc.) and it was great to see what I could do with different code. I struggled with some of the margins of my cards, header with the navigation and logo (they just did not want to get along), and the hover function.
